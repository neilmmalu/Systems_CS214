 In this assignment you will practice using the file system API (as well as pointers in different data
structures). In particular you will be creating, opening, reading, writing, and deleting files.
Your task is to write an indexing program, called an indexer. Given a set of files, an indexer will
parse the files and create an inverted index, which maps each token found in the files to the subset
of files that contain that token. In your indexer, you will also maintain the frequency with which
each token appears in each file. The indexer should tokenize the files and produce an inverted index of
how many times the word occurred in each file, sorted by word. Your output should be in the following
format:
